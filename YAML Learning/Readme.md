There are **more than 8 things** in YAML — but you have learned the **core fundamentals** that 90% of YAML files use.

If you want, we can continue learning the *next level* concepts.

Below is a full list divided into **Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced** so you see everything clearly.

---

# ✅ **BEGINNER (What you already learned)**

These are the essential building blocks:

1. **Key–value pairs**
2. **Indentation rules (spaces only)**
3. **Lists (`-`)**
4. **Nested maps and nested lists**
5. **Multi-line text (`|` and `>`)**
6. **Anchors & aliases (`&` and `*`)**
7. **Basic data types (string/number/bool/null/date)**
8. **Comments (`#`)**

These give you enough skill to read and write most YAML.

---

# 🔶 **INTERMEDIATE (Next things to learn — optional but useful)**

These are the next topics you can learn:

9. **YAML directives (`%YAML`)**
10. **Document separators (`---` and `...`)**
11. **Flow style (inline YAML)**
    Example:

```yaml
fruits: [apple, banana, mango]
person: {name: John, age: 25}
```

12. **Tagging types (`!!str`, `!!int`, etc.)**
13. **Custom data types**
14. **Merge keys (`<<:`)**
15. **YAML validation (linting)**

---

# 🔥 **ADVANCED (Used a lot in DevOps tools)**

16. **Schema-based YAML (Kubernetes, Ansible, Docker)**
17. **Environment variable substitution**
18. **YAML templating (Helm, Jinja2, Ansible variables)**
19. **Anchors in complex structures**
20. **Multi-document YAML files (common in Kubernetes)**
    Example:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
```

21. **YAML security (avoiding unsafe parsing)**

---

# ⭐ Total: YAML concepts are around 20+ topics

But you do **not** need all of them to be good at YAML.

You already learned the most important **8 fundamentals**.
